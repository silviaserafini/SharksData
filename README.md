HYPOTESIS:

After having read several articles about data sharks attacks, I would like to prove that:
    
    -the number of attacks has increased in the last 20 years
    -sharks are predators (they look for their victims and attack even if unprovoked);
    -'White' sharks are the most fatal;
    -USA ans Australia are the places with the highest number of attacks; 
    -the most dangerous species are the 'White', 'Tiger', 'Bull' sharks;

I would like to prove these 5 statements (hypotesis). 
 
HOW:

the project includes 2 files:
    
    -clean.ipynb : 
    
        -input : the shark attacks database https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks and cleans it; 
        -output : the cleaned database.
        
    -analysis.ipynb :
        
        -input : the cleaned database;
        -it performs the analysis and contains 5 take outs, proving the 5 statements of the hypothesis. 
        
All the 5 statements of the hypothesis were proved.
